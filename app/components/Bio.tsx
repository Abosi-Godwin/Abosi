        Frontend Developer & Web Designer based in Nigeria.
      </h6>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate <strong> Frontend Developer </strong>
        and <strong> Web Designer </strong> who specializes in crafting fast, responsive, and
        visually engaging websites. I blend design and development to create seamless user
        experiences using <strong>Next.js,</strong>
        <strong> React,</strong> and <strong>TailwindCSS.</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Beyond <strong>frontend development,</strong> I design and build eCommerce and CMS-powered
        websites with
        <strong> Shopify </strong> and <strong>WordPress,</strong> helping businesses turn ideas
        into functional digital experiences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My approach focuses on clarity, performance, and modern aesthetics — ensuring every project
        I build not only looks great but also performs effortlessly across devices.
